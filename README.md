This is the first Web application created as a project for the WebProgramming and Database course.
After completing my studies, I am starting to work on the following project to improve it from all points of view, Frontend and Backend.
Inside it there are some APIs
-API to get a list of foods
-API to make payments, more precisely with "Stripe"
